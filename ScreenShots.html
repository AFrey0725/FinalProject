            <p>I have learned a lot on how to create a webpage. This class taught me 
                how to create responsive and interactive content. I learned how to link pictures and 
                how to create and link a stylesheet in order to give my webpage style.
            </p>

            <p>I feel like I learned an entirely new language with this class and I understand more 
                about how to build your own website and make it functional. This class challenged me 
                and I really enjoyed learning everything I have learned this semester.
